# Making Sublime Text Awesome

one of the great things about Sublime text it that you can add extra functionality to it with plugins.  There are MANY great plugins out there but because this is just a little extra we're only going to look at 2 of them.

**Please Note:** If the workshop is already underway please do NOT do this now.  This is an extra for if you have a moment.  You can come back to this during a break or over the lunch hour.  It's much more important to listen to the workshop then do this stuff. 

## Package Manager

This is a plugin that makes adding plugins easier.  We will add this plugin first before the next one.  To add this plugin follow the instructions below:

* <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/installation" target="_blank"> open this link </a>
* Follow the instructions there.  **Please note that there are different installations involved for Sublime Text 2 or Sublime Text 3**
* Restart Sublime Text after installation of Package Manager
    * You'll want to close the program entirely and then open it again.
* After that You can test that the install worked correctly by installing the next plugin via package manager.

## Emmet

Emmet is an amazing plugin that makes working with HTML and CSS muuch more enjoyable by letting you learn a shorthand that sublime text will expand into the full text.  It's a "write less, do more" kind of thing.  Here's how to install it.

* In sublime text open the Command Pallete:
    * On a Mac you do this with &lt;CMD> + &lt;SHIFT> + &lt;P> (⌘⇧P)
    * On Windows you do this with &lt;CTRL> + &lt;SHIFT> + &lt;P> (^⇧P)
