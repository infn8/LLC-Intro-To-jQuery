### What Is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the **content** of your document. Using ```&lt;tags>``` we can create **elements** that represent items on our page.  Items like paragraphs.
```html
&lt;p>Paragraph Text&lt;/p>
```
Lists

```html
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>List Item&lt;/li> 
	&lt;li>List Item&lt;/li> 
	&lt;li>List Item&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul> 
```

and images

```html
&lt;img src="http://www.fillmurray.com/300/300" alt="Placeholder Image" />
```

				</section>
				<section class="slide">

<h2> By placing these items together on a page we get something that looks like this: </h2>

<p>Paragraph Text</p>
<ul>
<li>List Item</li> 
<li>List Item</li> 
<li>List Item</li>
</ul> 
<p><img src="http://www.fillmurray.com/300/300" alt="Placeholder Image" /></p>

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
### What Is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the **style** of your document. They help control the look and feel of the document. You create **selectors** that target **HTML Elements** and then use **CSS Rules** to change the look and feel of your document.

Selectors like:

	p { /* CSS Rules Here */ } 

Which targets all paragraphs, or:

	.rotator-slide { /* CSS Rules Here */ } 

Which targets *any* element with class="rotator-slide", or:

	#rotator { /* CSS Rules Here */ } 

Which targets *any* element with id="rotator".
					
				</section>
				<section class="slide">
<p>
	
<strong>CSS Rules</strong> go inside the {curly brackets} that follow the **CSS Selector** and they look like this:
</p>
<pre><code> p {
	font-size: 2em;
	color: red;
} </code></pre>
<p> Which will apply the font size of <strong>2em</strong> and color of <strong>red</strong> to all paragraphs. </p>

<p style="font-size: 2em; color: red;">This is a paragraph with the styles above applied to it.</p>

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
### What Is JS?

JS (JavaScript) controls the **behavior** of your document. It allows you to do things such as animate items, hide or show items, react to user input and even process data and perform other general programming tasks.

JS can look like this:

	var myVariable = "Hello World";

That line will create a variable called **myVariable** and assign it a value of **Hello World** (without the quotes).

The structure and syntax of the language of JavaScript is much more complex than either HTML or CSS.  

This is because neither HTML nor CSS are full fledged programming languages.  Neither of them have **variables**, **functions**, **objects** or **control structures** such as **if** statements or **loops**.  JavaScript has *all* of these.
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>

## So what *are* **variables**, **functions**, **objects** and **control structures** such as **if** statements or **loops**?

They are the basic building blocks of programming!

We can use these things to give sets of instructions to browsers that visit our webpages. 
#### Let's look at some of these things now:
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Variables

### What *is* a variable?

A variable is a named memory location which contains some known or unknown quantity or information.

#### In *English* professor.

At its most basic we make a variable when we give a **name** to a **value**.  So when we say:

	var myVariable = "Hello World";

We are taking the value ```Hello World``` and giving it the name ```myVariable```.  
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Variable Types

Variable **values** can be one of several different **types**.  The most basic is a **number**

	var meaningOfLife = 42; // Whole numbers are called 'integers'

Javascript can do math with numbers.
```javascript
 var endingValue = 5 * 2;
 // the asterisk '*' is the symbol for multiplication.
 // This will set the value of 'endingValue' to 10.
 ```

The calculations work the same whether the values are either numbers, or values stored in a variable:

```javascript
 var startingValue = 5;
 var multiplier = 2;
 var endingValue = startingValue * multiplier;
 // 'endingValue' is still 10.
 ```
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Variable Types

When you store any amount of text, like words or sentances for example, the variable type is a **string** value.

```javascript
var myVariable = "Hello World";
 ```

You can add strings together to make longer strings 
```javascript
var first = "Hello";
var second = "World";
var wholePhrase = first + " " + second;
 ```

The javascript above adds **three** items together:

1. the variable **first** with the value "Hello"
* the **anonymous** string value " "
* the variable **second** with the value "World"

"Hello" + " " + "World" = "Hello World"

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Variable Types

Javascript understands stings as values that are wrapped in either 'single quotes'  or "double quotes".  

You can use either style of quotation mark but you must both start and end the string with the same mark you began with:

```javascript
var works     = "This string value's the bomb!!!";
var fails     = 'This string value's the bomb!!!';                                                     ';
var alsoWorks = "Then I said: 'That string value was the bomb!!!'.";
var alsoFails = "Then I said: "That string value was the bomb!!!".";                                   
/* ' /*         ^             ^
				|             | 
				|_____________| 
				|
				Javascript thinks the string ends with the apostrophe.

				It is then expecting the command to end with a semicolon (;) 
				This doesn't happen and the following Error is thrown:
				
					"SyntaxError: missing ; before statement" 
*/
```
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Variable Types

You can use the double quote mark (") inside a string that is **delimited** by double quotes by putting a backslash (\\) in front of it.

```javascript
var totallyWorks = "Then I said: \"No way you can do that!!!\".";
/* ' /*            ^                                           ^
				   |                                           | 
				   |___________________________________________| 
				   |
Javascript sees a string starting and ending with the same symbol.

No Error is thrown. 

The variable totallyWorks is assigned a string value of:

	Then I said: "No way you can do that!!!".
*/
```
We use the quote marks to **delimit** a string but that does not add the **value** of the quote mark to the **content** of the string.

## Exercise 1

### The Console:

The console is an interactive tool that a browser has for users and developers to interact with web pages. It looks like this:

![The Console](img/the_console.jpg)

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Exercise 1

### The Console:
In Chrome, to open the Console tab, do any of the following:

* Use the keyboard shortcut: 
	* ```&LT;COMMAND> + &LT;OPTION> + &LT;J>``` (MAC)
	* ```&LT;CONTROL> + &LT;SHIFT> + &LT;J>``` (WINDOWS/LINUX).
* Or Select: ```View > Developer > JavaScript Console```.

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Exercise 1

### The Console:

Let's do that now.  Open your console by one of the those methods.  You will know you're at the right place when your screen's bottom half is now the console and this top part of the screen is much smaller.  When you're done you can close the console with the (x) button in the top right of it: 

![The Console](img/the_console_x.jpg)
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Exercise 1

### The Console:

Practice opening and closing the console in a way you're confortable with.  My personal favorite is the keyboard shortcut.  It's quick and clean. 

#### Now let's try typing some input into the console:

Let's type a number.  How about we try ```30```.  ```30```'s a nice round number.  

Open your console and type a ```3``` followed by a ```0``` and hit ```&lt;ENTER>```.  You'll likely see something that looks like this:

```javascript
> 30
< 30
```
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Exercise 1

### The Console:

The ```>``` symbol is used by the console to represent a space for your input.  

The ```&lt;``` symbol is used by the console to represent the **returned value** of your input.  

#### You don't have to type either ```>``` or ```&lt;``` into the console.

Your input was the integer value of ```30``` and the **returned value** was also ```30```.
```javascript
> 30
< 30
```

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Exercise 1

### The Console:

Let's try making a variable.  Type this command: 

```bash
> myFirstVariable = "Hello World!";
```
#### Remember that the ```>``` symbol is already there and you don't need to type it.

The **returned value** you should get is:

```bash
&lt; "Hello World!"
```

This tells you that javascript got your message and assigned that value to ```myFirstVariable```.

Now let's use that variable:
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Exercise 1

### The Console:

Try executing this command:
```bash
> myFirstVariable;
```
Then notice that your console displays:

```bash
&lt; "Hello World!"
```

This is because we told the console to give us the value of the variable ```myFirstVariable``` which it did.  That value was the one we gave it of ```Hello World!```


				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Exercise 1

### The Console:

Consider the following series of commands:

```bash
> secondsPerMinute = 60;
&lt; 60
> minutesPerHour = 60;
&lt; 60
> hoursPerDay = 24;
&lt; 24
> secondsPerDay = secondsPerMinute * minutesPerHour * hoursPerDay;
&lt; 86400
```

This not only gives us 4 new **variables**, all with **integer values**, but it also gives us the knowledge that there are indeed eighty six thousand four hundred seconds in a day.
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Variable Types

Variables that contain true / false values are called **booleans**

	var isJavaScriptCool = true;
	var isJavaScriptLame = false;
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Variable Types

Variables can even hold lists of values (the list values themselves being **types** like strings or booleans) in what is called an **array**
```javascript
var myFavoriteThings = [
	"Raindrops On Roses",
	"Whiskers On Kittens",
];
```
The values in an array can then be accessed by their **numerical index**, a number that stars at ```0``` and rises by ```1``` with each entry.  

The same end result as the code above could also be written like this:
```javascript
myFavoriteThings[0] = "Raindrops On Roses";
myFavoriteThings[1] = "Whiskers On Kittens";
```


				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Variable Types

Another type of variable that can hold other variable inside it is caled an **object**. Like arrays, objects can hold other values inside of them.
```javascript
var vonTrappFamily = {
	father : "Captain Georg von Trapp",
	stepmother : "Maria von Trapp",
	children : [
		"Liesl von Trapp",
		"Friedrich von Trapp",
		"Louisa von Trapp",
		"Brigitta von Trapp",
		"Marta von Trapp",
		"Gretl von Trapp",
	]
};
```
Notice how we use the curly braces ```{ }``` to denote an object and the square braces ```[ ]``` for an array.

In the example above the object has 3 **properties** ```father, stepmother & children``` 


				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Variable Types

The value of the property ```father``` is a **string** of text.

The value of the property ```stepmother``` is a **string** of text.

The value of the property ```children``` is a **array** of items, each of which is a **string** of text.

The patern of an object is like this:

```javascript
var variableName = { propertyName : propertyValue, anotherPropertyName : another Value };
/*                 |     |        |      |       |         |                 |         |
                   |     |        |      |       |         |_________________|   curly brace 
                   |     |        |      |       |                           |   closes object
                   |     |        |      |       |          This can repeat for
                   |     |        |      |       |          as many properties as you like.
                   |     |        |      |       └ A comma (,) seperates properties
                   |     |        |      └ The property value follows the colon.
                   |     |        └ A colon (:) is used to seperate name from value
                   |     └  The property name must start with a letter and contain no spaces
                   └ The Curly brace starts the object.
*/
```

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Variable Types

Object values are accessed or set via a syntax called **dot notation**.  This means that we could say something like.
```javascript
vonTrappFamily.father = "Captain Georg von Trapp";
```
Or we could get the value of one of the children by accessing an array value inside an object property:
```javascript
var notAllowedChampagne = vonTrappFamily.children[0];
```
This would set the value of the variable ```notAllowedChampagne``` to the string ```Liesl von Trapp```.

### The variables that live inside objects are called ```properties```

They are still variables they are just called **properties**.

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Variable Types

There are *many* different types of variable types in javascript and many rules about how to write them.

We will not go into an exhaustive list here but it is important that you understand that variables hold values and the values themselves have types.

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Ok now what?

Now... we write code.

### What code?

That depends on what you want to do.  

What do you want your **program** to do?  Because now we are at the point where we're writing lines of javascript.  We are writing software.  Software is just a series of commands for a computer.  Using javascript, we could tell a browser to do the following things:

* Pay attention to the links in the main menu of our page.
* Whevener someone hovers over one of those menu items, move a line to highlight the hovered item.
* When the mouse leaves, move the line back where it was.


				</section>
				<section class="slide" >
 <p>Something like that might look like this:</p>


<div class="example example-1">
<ul>
	<li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
	<li class="active"><a href="#">About Us</a></li>
	<li><a href="#">Media</a></li>
	<li><a href="#">Advertise</a></li>
	<li><a href="#">Contact Us</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="layline"></div>
</div>
<style>
	
	.example-1{
		position: relative;
	}
	.example-1 li{
		display: inline-block;
	}
	.example-1 li a{
		padding: 10px;
	}
	.example-1 li a:hover{
		padding: 10px;
		color:#b109aa;

		transition: all 800ms ease-in-out;
	}
</style>
<script>
	
	$(function() {
		$ex = $('.example-1');
		$ll = $ex.find('.layline');
		$items = $ex.find('li');

		moveLine = function(target){
			if($ex.is(':target .example')){
				$active = $items.filter('.active');
				$ll.width($active.width() ).css('left', $active.position().left );
			}
		}
		window.onhashchange = moveLine;
		$(window).bind('load', moveLine);
		$items.hover(function(){
			// Hover Over
			$active = $(this);
			$ll.width($active.width() ).css('left', $active.position().left );
		}, function(){
			// Hover Out
			$active = $items.filter('.active');
			$ll.width($active.width() ).css('left', $active.position().left );
		}).find('a').click(function(event) {
			event.preventDefault();
			$items.removeClass('active');
			$(this).parent().addClass('active');
			return false;
		});
	});
</script>
<p></p>
<p>The example above illustrates what a short series of commands can do.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when we have a series of commands that we run often, rather that writing out the same line, or lines, of code many times through out our program, we will create something called a <strong> function </strong> </p>

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>

## JavaScript Functions

if a variable is a **name** for a **value**, then a function is a **name** for a set of commands or instructions.  For example:
```javascript
function sayHello(){
	/*
	There can be many commands here in between the two {curly brackets}
	Let's make the first command an alert to the user.
	*/ 
	alert("Hello World");
}
```
This creates a new **function** called "sayHello" which, when invoked, will execute the **alert** function that comes built into javascipt.

The **alert** function is a **Built In Function** and the **sayHello** function is a **User Defined Function**.  The only difference between them is that you don't have to write a built in function, it comes for free as a part of JavaScript.
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>

## JavaScript Functions

Functions can be used to make your life a LOT easier once you get used to how to write them.  A function should be used when you have something you need to do time and again in your project.

### Function Parameters

Using the code from our previous slide:

```javascript
function sayHello(){
	alert("Hello World");
}
```
We notice that the ```sayHello()``` function has empty parenthesis () while the ```alert()``` function has the **string** value "Hello World" in the parenthesis ().


This introduces an important concept with functions called **parameters**.

 
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## JavaScript Functions
### Function Parameters

**Parameters** are data that you pass to a function that becomes available for use IN that function as a variable.  Let's say that rather than simply saying "Hello World", you might want to say something else, or many other things.  Let's see what that might look like:

```javascript
function sayAnything(message){
	alert(message);
}
```

Now if we wanted to use that code we could do this:

```javascript
sayAnything("Check out my cool new boombox!");
```
Which would cause the browser to pop up that message. [Or any other message we wanted to say](#example_2).

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## JavaScript Functions
					
The general pattern looks like this:

```javascript
myCustomFunction(parameter1, parameter2, parameterN);
/*     |              |           |          |
	   |              |           |          └ You can have as many 
	   |              |           |            parameters as you need.
	   |              |           └ The second parameter of the function.
	   |              └ The first parameter of the function.
	   └ The name of your function.

*/


```

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## JavaScript Functions

A function is one of the most powerful tools in JavaScript and one of the most powerful functions you will ever use is this one:

```javascript
jQuery();
```

## JavaScript Functions

A function is one of the most powerful tools in JavaScript and one of the most powerful functions you will ever use is this one:

```javascript
jQuery();
```
### So *what is* **jQuery** anyways?

jQuery is a JavaScript **library**. Meaning that it is a set of pre written coded instructions, tools, functions and helpers that you can download and then use in your projects. 

Think of it this way.  If JavaScript is a language like english, then jQuery is like a dictionary.  It makes working with the language easier.

# You Already Know How To Use jQuery

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## jQuery
### Using jQuery
					
Because you already know how to select **HTML Elements** with **CSS Selectors**.

```css
	.menu-item { color : blue; } 
/*       ^        ^       ^
		 |        |       └ The value of the CSS property is set to blue
		 |        └ The CSS property we're setting is color
		 └ HTML Elements with a class of 'menu-item' are selected
*/
```

				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## jQuery
### Using jQuery
					
Because you already know how to select **HTML Elements** with **CSS Selectors**.

```css
	.menu-item { color : blue; }
/*       ^        ^       ^
		 |        |       └ The value of the CSS property is set to blue
		 |        └ The CSS property we're setting is color
		 └ HTML Elements with a class of 'menu-item' are selected
*/
```
That same code in jquery is done like this:
```javascript
	jQuery('.menu-item').css('color', 'blue');
```
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## jQuery
### Using jQuery
					
Let's look at what is going on here:

```javascript
jQuery('.menu-item').css('color', 'blue');
/* ^         ^        ^     ^        ^
   |         |        |     |        └ The second css function parameter sets the css value
   |         |        |     |        
   |         |        |     └ The first css function parameter sets the css property
   |         |        |     
   |         |        └ The jquery function 'css' is called.  This lets us 
   |         |          effect the css of the matched html elements
   |         |
   |         └ The parameter sent to the jquery function is a 'string' value
   |           that takes the form of a css selector
   | 
   └ The jquery function. This is the super important part.  
	 this makes everything else here work.

## What can we do with jQuery?

jQuery is a general purpose library.  That means that is is designed to be as helpful as possible over a large number of situations.  

We can use jQuery to:

* Animate Items
* Perform both simple and complex interactions with your users
* Create rich user experiences with components like: 
	* Tabs
	* Accordians
	* Draggable & droppable items
	* Image Rotators
* Serve a random background image each time a page loads.
* Create an 'infinite scroll' effect by loading more items when a user reaches the bottom of the page
* Create complex layouts that are not possible with CSS alone.
* Detect the capabilities of a browser before serving up functionality like CSS Animations.

<h2>jQuery Examples:</h2>

<p>Here are several different examples in one section.  Each button below has been given instructions to follow when clicked.</p>

<p data-height="200" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="aKnJm" data-default-tab="result" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/infn8/pen/aKnJm/'>jQuery Event and Method Examples</a> by Arron Gibson (<a href='http://codepen.io/infn8'>@infn8</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<p>Have a look at the HTML, CSS, &amp; JS tabs as well as the Result tab.</p>
<p>The <strong>HTML</strong> consists of several <code>&lt;button></code> elements, a <code>&lt;div class="stage">&lt;/div></code> and inside that a <code>&lt;div class="player">&lt;/div></code> </p>
<p>The <strong>CSS</strong> exists only to add a little form to the example.  Make the squares red and 50px across.  Float them left so that they sit side by side.
</p>
<p>The jQuery is where all the cool stuff is happening.</p>

### Downloading and using jQuery.

We can download the latest version of jQuery from their website at [jQuery.com](http://jquery.com).

![jQuery download page](./img/example_jquery_1.jpg)

Click the big "Download jQuery" button.
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown> 
## jQuery
### Downloading and using jQuery.

This will take you to [http://jquery.com/download/](http://jquery.com/download/) where you will see links to several different versions of jQuery.  There is a lot of information on this page but we want to focus on the dowloads for [jQuery 1.x](http://jquery.com/download/#jquery-1-x) and [jQuery 2.x](http://jquery.com/download/#jquery-2-x).

The newest version of jQuery (Version 2.1.1) is arguably the best vesion yet.  It is lean and fast and very powerful.  In order to achieve that power the jQuery team had to make a difficult choice. They had to drop support for Internet Explorer 6, 7 &amp; 8.  

Version 2 doesn't do anything that version 1 doesn't do, it just does it all **much faster**. Unless you are *certain* no IE 6/7/8 users are visiting your site, you should use the Version 1 of jQuery.

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown> 
## jQuery
### Downloading and using jQuery.

To download jQuery find the link that says [Download the compressed, production jQuery 1.11.1](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js)

![jQuery download page](./img/example_jquery_2.jpg)

Right click that link and choose **Save Link As...** and choose the location on your computer where you are storing your project.  


				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown> 
## jQuery
### Downloading and using jQuery.

After saving it to your computer, open up the folder where you are storing your Hackapalooza project. (Windows users will use Windows Explorer and Mac Users will use Finder)  Create a new folder in the project and call it 'js', This is where we will store all our javascript files. 

It is always a good idea to keep your project organized so keeping your files in folders like 'js', 'css', and 'img' is a good practice to follow.

Drag the file **jquery-1.11.1.min.js** into that new **js** folder.

You have now downloaded jQuery.  The next step is to put it to use.


				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown> 
## Take A Breather.

Take a moment to work with your mentors to ensure that you have the **jquery-1.11.1.min.js** file saved to your computer in the '**js**' folder in your **hackapalooza project folder**.

We will continue once everyone has had a chance to make sure that they are this far and to have asked their mentors any questions they may have.

If you are having trouble [Right click this link to the jQuery library file and press **Save Link As...** and choose the location on your computer where you are storing your Hackapalooza project](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js).  Save the file in the subdirectory **js** in that location.

## Let's Review

We have covered a lot so far, let's make sure we have a handle on all of this up to now.

* **HTML** is what makes the content of a webpage.
* **CSS** is what makes the look and feel of a webpage.
* **JS** is ```JavaScript``` and it is what makes the behavior of a webpage.
* **jQuery** is a library, written in JS, designed to make adding behavior to webpages easier than writing regular javascript.
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown> 
## Let's Review


* JS has **variables**, which are named values that you can use to store things like numbers, strings of text and other JavaScript data types.
* JS also has **functions**, which are named collections of commands that you can use to execute similar commands over and over again without having to write out all the commands in the function each time you use it.
* The power of the jQuery library comes from the **jQuery()** function.

Ok enough review let's start using jQuery!
				</section>
				<section class="slide">
				<h2> Using jQuery. </h2>
<p> You can include jQuery in your pages with one single line of HTML. </p>




<pre><code class="HTML"> &lt;script src="js/jquery-1.11.1.js">&lt;/script></code></pre>

<p>In this code, there is a <code>&lt;script></code> tag, with a single <strong> attribute </strong> called <code>src</code> which tells the browser where to find the script.</p>
<p>In our case, the script is named '<code>jquery-1.11.1.js</code>' and it is located in a subdirectory called '<code>js</code>'. </p>
<p>
Once the jQuery library is included on our page, we can start to make use of the magic of jQuery.
</p>
<!-- <p>In order for that to do what we want the jQuery file must be where we say it is.  
</p>
<h4>
	To get the file on your computer we use the same process we would for ANY file... We download it.
</h4>
 -->                </section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown> 
## Using jQuery
### Step 1, include the jQuery file on your HTML page using a new tag called:
```HTML
&lt;script>
```

Let's open up the files we downloaded at the beginning of the project.  They're on your desktop unless you put them elsewhere.

If you haven't already unzipped [the file here](https://github.com/infn8/LLC-Intro-To-jQuery/archive/master.zip) please do that now.  Open up the folder that is likely called ```LLC-Intro-To-jQuery-master``` and look for a folder called ```examples``` and in that folder another one called ```example-1```.

Inside that folder there is a file called ```index.html```. 

Open that file in a browser by double clicking it. 

[You can click here if you're viewing this slide presentation from the same zip file](examples/example-1/index.html).

				</section>
				<section class="slide"> 
<h2> Using jQuery </h2>
<p> Open that SAME file in Sublime Text and locate the section of your html file called the <strong>head</strong> of the document.  it should look like this: </p>

<pre><code class="HTML">&lt;head>
  &lt;title>Ladies Learning Code HTML and CSS&lt;/title>
  &lt;link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Oswald' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="normalize.css" />
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  &lt;script src="js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js">&lt;/script>
  &lt;!-- Your jQuery code will go here. -->
&lt;/head> </code></pre>
<p> Inside the head tag put in the following new tag. <small>(Right where the comment says to put it!)</small> </p>
<pre><code class="HTML">&lt;script src="js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Pro Tip: There is another file called snippets.txt in the example-1 folder.  you can copy and paste from there.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="slide">

<h2>What did we just do?</h2>

<p>Let's have a look.</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">// Let's break this down.
&lt;script src="js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
/*  |    |                 |              └ The closing 'script' tag.
    |    |                 └ The location of the JS file.
    |    └ The 'src' attribute of the 'script' tag expects a file location.
    └ The 'script' tag.  
      In HTML this tells the document that it's about to get JS commands.
*/
</code></pre>

<p>What we did was to add a new JS file to our document.  Now the JavaScript commands written in that document will be run when the webpage loads.</p>

<p>Great! Now let's go reload our page and see what jquery does when you include it in an HTML file.</p>


				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown> 
## Notice any difference in your project?
### No?

That's because the jQuery library on its own doesn't DO anything, it simply gives you the tools to do something. What we do is up to us.

Now that jQuery is on the page we can use the **jQuery();** function which is the real magic of jQuery.
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown> 
## Using jQuery and the jQuery(); function

The basic idea of jQuery is that you target some item on the page and then add or change the behavior of that item.

## How to select an item with jQuery(); 
### (So you can alter its behavior)

the ```jQuery();``` function takes a single parameter:  A string containing a CSS style selector indicating what item, or items, on the page to select.

Some examples:

```javascript
jQuery("ul li.even");
```
The line above selects all list items, with a class of "even" in an any unordered list.

```javascript
jQuery("#rotator .slide:first");
```
The line above selects the first item with a class of "slide" inside the item with an id of "rotator".

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown> 
## How to select an item with jQuery(); 
### (So you can alter its behavior)

The HTML items or your page that match your selector are added into something called the **wrapped set**.  This is a special grouping of items that jQuery uses to know what items to alter or add behavior to.

When you run a jQuery **method** the items in the **wrapped set** are the ones that will be altered or effected.
				</section>
				<section class="slide"> 
<h2> jQuery Methods </h2>
<p> the jQuery library comes with many many MANY different methods.  We won't discuss all of them here but if you want to see them all, and how to use them, you can go to <a href="http://api.jquery.com" target="_blank">api.jquery.com</a>.</p>
<p>We will discuss a few methods here and a few more once we start making our rotator.</p>
<ul>
	<li>the <strong>.hide();</strong> method will hide all elements in the wrapped set.</li>
	<li>the <strong>.show();</strong> method will show all elements in the wrapped set.</li>
	<li>the <strong>.css();</strong> method allows you to alter the look of the elements in the wrapped set by passing two parameters.  <ul><li> The CSS property you want to edit </li><li>and the new value of that property </li></ul> </li>
</ul>
<h3>Note:  A method is what we call an <strong>object property</strong> when it is a <strong>function</strong>. </h3>
<pre><code class="javascript">var instructor = {
	name : "Arron Gibson",
	greet : function(){
		alert("Greetings from Arron.  Welcome to my cool jQuery workshop!");
	}
}; </code></pre>
<script> var instructor = {name : "Arron Gibson", greet : function(){alert("Greetings from Arron.  Welcome to my cool jQuery workshop!"); } }; </script>
<p><code>instructor</code> is an <strong>object</strong>, That object has a <strong>property</strong> called <code>name</code> and a <strong>method</strong> called <code>greet</code>.</p>

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown> 

## jQuery Methods

For example:

```javascript
jQuery(".alert").css("color", "red");</code></pre>
```
Will take elements with a class of alert and make the text in them red.

This by no means an exhaustive list, we will take notice when we intruduce new methods as we go on.
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown> 
## An Amazing Shortcut
### The Dollar Sign
```javascript
var $ = jQuery;
```
Anytime you want to write ```jQuery``` you can just write ```$``` instead.  It saves a lot of time.  Writing:
```javascript
$('.myClass');
```
is the same as writing:
```javascript
jQuery('.myClass');
```
and that's just what we'll be doing going forward.


				</section>
				<section class="slide"> 




<h2> Let's DO something already!!!
</h2>
<h3>
	
Ok let's get into it.  
</h3>
<p>
	
Go back to that folder on the desktop and open up the <code>example-2</code> folder inside the <code>examples</code> folder.
</p>
<p>
	
<a href="examples/example-2/index.html" target="_blank">open the <strong>index.html</strong> file</a> in both chrome and sublime text.  Now we can make edits to the file and then refresh the browser to see the updates.  Look in sublime text for the part in the code that looks like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;script src="js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
&lt;!-- Your jQuery code will go here. -->
</code></pre>
<p>That is where we are going to write our jQuery.  We're going to add a new <strong>script</strong> tag there. Update the page so it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;script src="js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
	 /* Your jQuery code will go here. */
&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
</code></pre>

				</section>




				<section class="slide" data-markdown> 
## Timing.

Your webpage, like all webpages, gets downloaded by the browser.  The browser downloads the page from top to bottom and when it see any javascript, it runs it.  Right then and there.  So if you add this:
```javascript 
$("p.highlight").css("background-color", "yellow");
```
and then later in the page you put

```html
&lt;p class="highlight">This is an important highlighted paragraph&lt;/p>
```
The javascript code will run BEFORE the browser will even see the paragraph tag.  That means that jQuery won't match the element and won't make it's background color yellow!

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown> 
## Enter Document Ready

Document ready is an **event**.  It's a *point in time* when the browser has downloaded enough of your page that it has seen all your tags and it can find them based off of the CSS selectors that you tell jQuery.

Running that same code on the **document ready** event looks like this:
```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
	$("p.highlight").css("background-color", "yellow");
});
```
Document Ready is a little bit of a complex idea and again because we only have a small amount of time we won't explain how it works in great detail here.  Just trust me, you need it if you want your code to work. 
				</section>
				<section class="slide">
<p> Now take the part of our html page where it says: </p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;script src="js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
	/* Your jQuery code will go here. */
&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and <strong> make it </strong> say this:</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;script src="js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
	// Add all jQuery code here.
});
&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That area is where we will add ALL of our jQuery code going forward.  When I say "Add this code to your document ready function" that is where I mean.</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;script&gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
	// Right Here. Your code goes Right here.
});
&lt;&#47;&#115;cript&gt;

On the example page we have a section at the bottom where there are 4 pictures of my dog Phoenix.

![She is a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retreiver](img/Screen-Shot-1.png)

Let's have some fun with those!
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>

The HTML for that section looks like this:

```html
&lt;section id="favourites" class="favourites box">
	&lt;h2>My Favourite Things&lt;/h2>
	&lt;h3>Here are a few things I really love&lt;/h3>
	&lt;img class="favourite" src="images/puppy_rest.jpg">
	&lt;img class="favourite" src="images/puppy_rest.jpg">
	&lt;img class="favourite" src="images/puppy_rest.jpg">
	&lt;img class="favourite" src="images/puppy_rest.jpg">
&lt;/section>
```
So how would we **select** those images with jQuery?
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>

The HTML for that section looks like this:

```html
&lt;section id="favourites" class="favourites box">
	&lt;h2>My Favourite Things&lt;/h2>
	&lt;h3>Here are a few things I really love&lt;/h3>
	&lt;img class="favourite" src="images/puppy_rest.jpg">
	&lt;img class="favourite" src="images/puppy_rest.jpg">
	&lt;img class="favourite" src="images/puppy_rest.jpg">
	&lt;img class="favourite" src="images/puppy_rest.jpg">
&lt;/section>
```
So how would we **select** those images with jQuery? How about this?
```javascript
$("#favourites img");
```
Yep that would do it.
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>

Now let's try changing their size.  Make your **document ready** event look like this:
```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
	$("#favourites img").width(100);
});
```
Then save the file with sublime, go to chrome and refresh the page.  If you've done it right it should look like this:

![That's a Tiny Toller](img/Screen-Shot-2.png)

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>

What about Bigger?  What if your **document ready** event looked like this?:
```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
	$("#favourites img").width(400);
});
```

Again, save the file with sublime, go to chrome and refresh the page.  
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>

If you've done it right it should look like this:

![That's a HUGE Toller](img/Screen-Shot-3.png)

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Hover and Click Events

Setting the width of something is pretty cool but we could use CSS to do that.  Let's try something only JavaScript could help us with. Let's add a **click event**.

Like the document ready **event**, a click event is a moment in time when we want to trigger some code to run.  But instead of the browser running the document ready event right away, it only runs a click event when an item is actually clicked by the user.

When we add a function to a **user triggered event** like this we call it an **event listener**.  Our code just sits around waiting and listening for the event to happen.  When someone finally clicks the item it triggers our function to run. 
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Hover and Click Events

To add an **event listener** to our items we need to select them just like anything else with jQuery.
```javascript
$("#favourites img");
```
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Hover and Click Events

To add an **event listener** to our items we need to select them just like anything else with jQuery.
```javascript
$("#favourites img");
```
Then we add the ```.click()``` **method**
```javascript
$("#favourites img").click();
```
				</section>

## Hover and Click Events

To add an **event listener** to our items we need to select them just like anything else with jQuery.
```javascript
$("#favourites img");
```
Then we add the ```.click()``` **method**
```javascript
$("#favourites img").click();
```
We pass a single **parameter** to that method.  That parameter is itself a **function**.
```javascript
$("#favourites img").click(function(){ });
```
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Hover and Click Events

```javascript
$("#favourites img");
```
Then we add the ```.click()``` **method**
```javascript
$("#favourites img").click();
```
We pass a single **parameter** to that method.  That parameter is itself a **function**.
```javascript
$("#favourites img").click(function(){ });
```
inside that function we write the code that will take place when the image is clicked
```javascript
$("#favourites img").click(function(){ 
	/* Our code goes here */
});
```
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Hover and Click Events

Let's make the click event hide the picture.
```javascript
$("#favourites img").click(function(){ 
	$(this).hide();
});
```
The code above will take the clicked image and set it so it does not display.  The item is still there, we just cant see it. [You can see an example of this in action here](examples/example-2/index.hide.html#favourites).

What if we wanted to make the image animate away before being hidden?  Well the hide **method** accepts a **parameter** for how long the hiding should take to occur.
```javascript
$("#favourites img").click(function(){ 
	$(this).hide(1000);
});
```

This will make the act of hiding the image take 1000 milliseconds, or 1 second.

[You can see that in action here](examples/example-2/index.hide.1000.html#favourites).

What if we just want to hide it for a bit, then show it again?  well we can do what's called **chaining** our methods.
```javascript
$("#favourites img").click(function(){ 
	$(this).hide(1000).show('fast');
});
```
[View This](examples/example-2/index.hide.show.html#favourites).


All jquery methods can chain together with a dot (.) in between them.  That means that [this silliness](examples/example-2/index.hide.show.silly.html#favourites) is perfectly valid and will work just fine.
```javascript
$("#favourites img").click(function(){ 
$(this).hide(1000).show('fast').fadeOut('slow').fadeIn(5000).slideUp(800).slideDown(10000);
});
```
All of these **methods** accept a **parameter** for how long the animation should take.  in jQuery any time you can provide a duration to an animation you can either use a **number** of milliseconds, or a **string** value of either "```fast```" or "```slow```" which mean 400 and 600 milliseconds respectively.

## What the heck is ```$(this)```?!?!

You may have noticed the following code in the previous several examples
```javascript
$(this)
```
So what is ```$(this)``` and what does it do?  

### Good question!

when you are writing code inside of a function that is passed to a jQuery **method** like we are here:

```javascript
$("#favourites img").click(function(){ 
	$(this).hide(1000);
});
```
jQuery gives us a special variable called ```this``` as a helper.  

The ```this``` variable is always equal to the specific *HTML element* that has been clicked and that our **event listener** is acting upon.  We add the ```$()``` around it to make that element be inside a **wrapped set** so that we can run all of the jQuery **methods** on it.

## jQuery Plugins

jQuery is an extremely capable library on its own.  It comes with hundreds of **methods**, many other helper **properties** and the ability to select items for the wraped set based on **CSS Syntax**.

jQuery is an extremely capable library on its own.  It comes with hundreds of **methods**, many other helper **properties** and the ability to select items for the wraped set based on **CSS Syntax**.  

### But jQuery doesn't & can't do everything.  

There would be no way to write a library with methods to handle everything any user would ever want to do.  Even if that was possible, it would make the library so large that it would take browsers a very long time to download it and the initial page loading speed of any site that used it would be *VERY SLOW*.

### Enter Plugins

A jQuery plugin is some code that *someone else* has written, that you can use, to achieve certain goals that the jQuery library itself is not designed to handle.

				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## jQuery Plugins

Some examples of jQuery plugins are 

* [Scroll Magic](http://janpaepke.github.io/ScrollMagic/)
	* A plugin to make it easy for adding effects based on the users scroll position on the page
* [ToolTipster](http://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/#demos)
	* Custom pretty Tool Tips
* [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/)
	* A collection of UI widgets designed to make adding complex user interactions easier and very themeable. 
		* This plugin is developed by the jQuery team itself
		* **UI = User Interface**
* [FlexSlider](http://flexslider.woothemes.com/)
	* The best responsive slider. Period.
	* We are going to use this Plugin to add a slider of images to our project

## So, What IS an image rotator?

At it's most basic, a rotator is a list of images that uses javascript to show one image on its own, then another, then another...  SO if we used HTML like this:

```html
&lt;div id="rotator">
	&lt;ul class="slides">
		&lt;li>&lt;img src="img/rotator/image1.jpg" alt="First Slide">&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>&lt;img src="img/rotator/image2.jpg" alt="Second Slide">&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>&lt;img src="img/rotator/image3.jpg" alt="Third Slide">&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;/div>
```

The javascript would show the first and hide the rest. Then, after a couple of seconds,  show the second and hide the rest.  Then keep going until all of the slides have been shown.  Then start again at the beginning.

## Enter Flexslider

Flexslider is a very capable, well maintained and responsive jQuery rotator.  Best of all it's free and easy to use.

### Downloading Flexslider

Head on over to [http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/](http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/)

Click the big green download button and download the zip file.  Expand that zip file and then take the entire folder that comes out of it and drop it into the 'js' folder in your project.  Rename that folder to 'flexslider' (all lowercase) and then we're good.  It should look like this:

![Flexslider in the project directory](./img/example_flexslider_1.jpg)

## Ok Breathe...

You now have averything in place to make your slider. All we have to do after this is:

1. Figure out where on your page you want to put the rotator.
* Figure out what images you want to use in the rotator
* Figure out if you want to have captions (Text to accompany each slide in the rotator)
* Add the **HTML** needed for the rotator
* Trigger flexslider to add new **behavior** to that HTML.
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown> 

#### From this point forward...

we will be writing code on our projects that will be individualized to our own needs.

I will give example **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and **jQuery** code but you will need to adapt that code to do *what you want to do for your project*.
				</section>
				<section class="slide"> 
<h2> Next Steps </h2>

<p> The <strong> HTML </strong> </p>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;section id="rotator" class="rotator box">
  &lt;div class="flexslider">
	&lt;ul class="slides">
	  &lt;li>
		&lt;img src="images/rotator-1.jpg" alt="Rotator Image 1">
		&lt;div class="flex-caption">&lt;p>Slide Caption 1&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
	  &lt;/li>
	  &lt;li>
		&lt;img src="images/rotator-2.jpg" alt="Rotator Image 2">
		&lt;div class="flex-caption">&lt;p>Slide Caption 2&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
	  &lt;/li>
	  &lt;li>
		&lt;img src="images/rotator-3.jpg" alt="Rotator Image 3">
		&lt;div class="flex-caption">&lt;p>Slide Caption 3&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
	  &lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
  &lt;/div>
&lt;/section> </code></pre>
<p>This is the starter code that you should paste into your page where you want your rotator to go.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Making it your own.

* Edit the **amount** of list items in the slides list to match the amount of images you will be using.
* Edit the image **filenames** to point to the images you want to use
* Edit the **alt** attribute of each image to write a description of that image
* Edit the captions as you like
	* If you do not want captions delete the line 
```html
&lt;div class="flex-caption">&lt;p>Slide Caption 1&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
``` 
from each slide you don't want captions on.

## Making it work

In your **Document Ready Function** add the following code to tell flexslider to run:

```javascript
$('.flexslider').flexslider();
```  
Yep,  that's it.
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Making it work

In your **Document Ready Function** add the following code to tell flexslider to run:

```javascript
$('.flexslider').flexslider();
```  
Yep,  that's it.  You should now be able to load your page in your browser now and see your slider in action.

### Let's break that down
```javascript
	$('.flexslider').flexslider();
//  |      |             |     └ Parenthesis indicate a Function Call
//  |      |             └ The Flexslider Method 
//  |      └ The CSS selector '.flexslider' will add any items
//  |          with the class 'flexslider' to the jQuery wrapped set 
//  └ The jQuery Function
```
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Making it work
### The way you want it to.

Some of Flexslider's available options:

* Animation Type
	* **fade** or **slide**
* Slideshow Speed
	* The Amount of time, in milliseconds, between slides.
* Animation Loop
	* When you get to the last slide should you go back to the start?

There are many more options, [see a complete list on this page](http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/), but let's look at how to set them. 
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Using A Configuration Object with Flexslider

find the line in your code that says:
```javascript
$('.flexslider').flexslider();
```  
And change it to say this:
```javascript
$('.flexslider').flexslider({ animation : "slide" });
```  
Then reload your page.  Notice how your flexslider will now animate new slides in from the right to the left instead of disolving between the two images.  Now change it to say this:
```javascript
$('.flexslider').flexslider({ slideshowSpeed : 2000 });
```  
Reload that.  Do you notice a difference?

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
### Let's break that down
```javascript
	$('.flexslider').flexslider({ slideshowSpeed : 2000 });
//  |      |             |     ||       |            |  |└ End Parenthesis
//  |      |             |     ||       |            |  └ End Curly Brackets
//  |      |             |     ||       |            └ The property has
//  |      |             |     ||       |               a VALUE of 2000
//  |      |             |     ||       └ Set the object PROPERTY
//  |      |             |     ||         'slideshowSpeed'
//  |      |             |     |└ Curly brackets indicate a JavaScript OBJECT
//  |      |             |     └ Parenthesis indicate a Function Call
//  |      |             └ The Flexslider Method 
//  |      └ The CSS selector '.flexslider' will add any items
//  |          with the class 'flexslider' to the jQuery wrapped set 
//  └ The jQuery Function
```

We pass an **object** as a **parameter** to the flexslider **method** of jQuery.  

The **object** has **properties** and **values** that flexslider will use to override its defaults.
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## I Can Haz Responsive?

Flexslider comes out of the box with the ability to be responsive.  Try it now.  resize your browser and watch your images scale as needed.

#### Pro Tip:

Make your images only as wide as they NEED to be.  That is, the largest size that you will need in your design.  They will automatically scale down as needed, but if you make them larger then they need to be the file size will be larger and your page will download slower.
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Ok we are done now!

**Exciting** You now have a responsive image rotator on your project page full of the images that you want to show to people.  But why stop there right?  we can do better.  

Let's try a few more cool things.
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## The Thumbnail Slider

What if you wanted to have all your images to have a small row of thumbnails along the bottom to help with navigation for the user?

You can [see an example of this here](http://flexslider.woothemes.com/thumbnail-slider.html)

The steps for this are to create 2 seperate flexsliders. 1 is the **carousel**, the thumbnails at the bottom, and the other is the main rotator.

We create both of them and then give the JS the right commands to work for both of them and keep them in sync.

				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## The Randomness

What if we are showing a bunch of slides from different artists and we don't want to show preference to one artist over another?

```javascript
$('.flexslider').flexslider({ randomize: true });
```  
Boom!  impartial.
				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Clickable Slides

It is super simple to make your slides able to link to another page, or even another section on the same page.  Let's look at the HTML we are using now:
```html
&lt;div id="rotator">
	&lt;ul class="slides">
		&lt;li>&lt;img src="img/rotator/image1.jpg" alt="First Slide">&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>&lt;img src="img/rotator/image2.jpg" alt="Second Slide">&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>&lt;img src="img/rotator/image3.jpg" alt="Third Slide">&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;/div>
```
Now let's just wrap those images in links using the ```&lt;a>``` tag in **HTML**

```html
&lt;div id="rotator">
	&lt;ul class="slides">
		&lt;li>&lt;a href="#section1">&lt;img src="img/rotator/image1.jpg" alt="First Slide">&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>&lt;a href="#section2">&lt;img src="img/rotator/image2.jpg" alt="Second Slide">&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>&lt;a href="#section3">&lt;img src="img/rotator/image3.jpg" alt="Third Slide">&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;/div>
```


				</section>
				<section class="slide" data-markdown>
## Something that's not an image?

Flexslider works by rotating between slides *regardless of their content*. So you could easily do something like this:
```html
&lt;div id="rotator">
	&lt;ul class="slides">
		&lt;li>&lt;p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet&lt;/p>&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>&lt;p>consectetur adipisicing elit.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>
		&lt;li>&lt;p>Impedit, ullam iste pariatur enim consequuntur.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;/div>
```
